<h1 align="left"> CALCULATING QUANTITIES BETWEEN DATES </h1>

<p align="justify">In some situations it is necessary to calculate quantities (sum, count) between dates in the same table. To demonstrate the calculation we will use the example of how to calculate the <b>headcount</b> KPI.</p>
<p align="justify">We will use variables, and filter context to link the table D_CALENDAR to the table of admission and dismissal dates.</p>
<p align="justify">To build the example we use part of the HRDataset_v13.csv dataset for modeling and calculating the KPI, available in the kaggle repository.</p>
